# CSS Layouts and Responsive Design 

## Based on the assignment requirements, I designed a responsive webpage using Flexbox for the navigation bar and CSS Grid for the main content layout. Media queries were implemented to ensure seamless adaptation across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. Below is the step-by-step breakdown:

## Key Features
# 1.Flexbox Navigation:

The navbar uses display: flex for horizontal alignment.

Collapses to a vertical layout on mobile via media queries.

# 2.CSS Grid for Content:

A 3-column grid on desktop, 2-column on tablet, and 1-column on mobile.

# 3.Responsive Breakpoints:

Desktop: Default (3 columns).

Tablet: max-width: 768px (2 columns).

Mobile: max-width: 480px (1 column + stacked navbar).

Testing & Validation
Tools Used: Chrome DevTools, Firefox Responsive Design Mode.

# 4.Tested Devices:

Desktop (> 1024px).

iPad (768px).

iPhone 12 (390px).

Relatable Note
As a student balancing coursework and projects, I prioritized clean code and reusability to make future edits easier. Using emojis in the design adds a playful touch while keeping the layout professional. This assignment helped solidify my understanding of combining Flexbox and Grid for modern responsive designs!
